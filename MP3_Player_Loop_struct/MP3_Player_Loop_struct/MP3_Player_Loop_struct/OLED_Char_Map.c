/*****************************************************
*   Defines all ASCII values from 0x00 to 0x7E 
*   Control characters 0x00 to 0x0F print a space (blank character)
*   Control characters 0x10 to 0x1F print symbols as noted
*   All characters are 5 pixels wide and 7 pixels tall
*   Most significant bit is the bottom pixel.
*   Least significant bit is the top and left blank to provide a space between lines
*   Columns of the character are left to right
*   Example (character 0x41 ('A'):
*   {0xF8,0x24,0x22,0x24,0xF8} =
